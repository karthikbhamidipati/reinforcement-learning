Overview:
Implement reinforcement learning algorithm to find policies for frozenlake environment.

Reinforcement learning algorithms implemented:
1. Model based tabular algorithms:
   * Policy iteration
   * Value iteration
   * Policy improvement
2. Model free tabular algorithms:
   * SARSA control
   * Q-learning control
3. Model free non-tabular algorithms:
   * Linear approximation with SARSA control
   * Linear approximation with Q-learning control
   
Requirements:
python version 3.7 and above should be installed.         
Unzip the folder and run ```pip install -r requirements.txt```. This will install numpy


Execution:      
Execute the ```main_implementation.py``` file     

Explanation:       
   * main_implementation displays the policy and values for the small frozenlake, comment out line 135 if you want to execute only for small frozenlake
   * big_implementation displays the policy and values for the big frozenlake, comment out line 134 if you want to execute only for big frozenlake
